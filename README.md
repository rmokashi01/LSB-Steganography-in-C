# üñºÔ∏è LSB Steganography Tool in C

This project implements **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography** in C to hide and retrieve secret messages within BMP image files. It supports both **encoding** (hiding text data) and **decoding** (extracting it back), with detailed logging and error handling.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Embed secret `.txt` files inside `.bmp` images
- Decode and extract hidden messages
- Preserves original BMP headers
- Validates image capacity and file existence
- Auto-generates output file if not provided
- Informative debug logs for each step
- Designed for Linux (GCC)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation

Use the following command to build the project:

```bash
gcc -DDEBUG main.c encode.c decode.c -o lsb_steg -Wall -Wextra

## Encoding: Hide a secret text file in a BMP image
./lsb_steg -e beautiful.bmp secret.txt steged_beautiful.bmp

---

## Examples:
bash
./lsb_steg -e beautiful.bmp secret.txt steged_beautiful.bmp
./lsb_steg -e beautiful.bmp secret.txt


## Decoding: Extract the hidden secret file from a stego image
./lsb_steg -d <stego_image.bmp> <output_secret.txt>
./lsb_steg -d steged_beautiful.bmp secret_msg.txt
